# nibble-chess
    A tribute to chess programming community based on ideas taken from micro-Max by H.G. Muller

# Overview
    A large chess programming community helped me a lot over last three years, now I want to give
    it something back. Nibble chess is a simple console based chess program which can be extended
    to UCI chess engine. It's not intended to be used by end users, but by beginner programmers
    who looks for some sort of resources to get started with. I wish I could have such program
    when just started to learn chess programming. The source is mostly based on H.G. Muller's ideas, as
    they are implemented in his micro-Max engine. I've learnt how to use that code, but still don't
    understand how it works in details.
