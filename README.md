A tribute to chess programming community based on ideas taken from micro-Max by H.G. Muller

# Overview

    A large chess programming community helped me a lot over last three years, now I want to give
    it something back. Nibble chess is a simple console based chess program which can be extended
    to UCI chess engine. It's not intended to be used by end users, but by beginner programmers
    who looks for some sort of resources to get started with. I wish I could have such program
    when just started to learn chess programming. The source is mostly based on H.G. Muller's ideas, as
    they are implemented in his micro-Max engine.

# Features

    - 0x88 board representation
    - three nested loops pseudo-legal movegenerator
    - material evaluation + positional scores(stored in right part of 0x88 board)
    - tricky move ordering technique: scoring move scores during move generation 
    - very basic alpha-beta search
    - quiescence search
    - console-based interface

# Additional resources

    There are various code snippets available in res/ folder:
    
        - pretty fast move generator/perft tester with piece lists
        - reimplementation of micro-Max's move generator in NASM assembly
        - FEN parser for nibble chess
        - very basic and raw implementation of UCI loop
        - single file chess project template of my own design
